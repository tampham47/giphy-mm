What I have done in this project?

1. Create layout as expected design.
2. Make the website responsible in 3 screen sizes: mobile, tablet, and desktop.
3. When the user clicks on each image, the full gif image will be shown.
4. When the user hovers on each image, the gif image will be loaded.
5. Add favicon and app icon to make the project fancier.
6. Create a function that helps the user load more images.
7. Using styled-components instead of CSS components as default.
8. Saving data by implementing a function that shows gif on hovering.

Developing is a never-ending job, so for this project, I would like to spend only 8 hours, to see what I can do within a limited time. There are some functions I would like to pay attention to in case I have more time.

1. Using the layout alike Pinterest for this project, because the sizes of each image are so different.
2. Pay more attention to optimizing the data has been load by this project.
3. Add more test cases for each components.
4. I am a fan of server-side rendering, so I would like to do that if needed.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
